Explanation of Each Component
User Accessing the Website:

A user opens their web browser and types "www.foobar.com" into the address bar.
Domain Name (foobar.com):

Role: The domain name is a human-readable address that points to the IP address of the server hosting the website. In this case, "www.foobar.com" points to the IP address 8.8.8.8.
Type of DNS Record: The "www" in "www.foobar.com" is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record or an A record that maps the domain to the IP address 8.8.8.8.
Server:

What is a Server: A server is a powerful computer that provides data, resources, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
Web Server (Nginx):

Role: The web server handles HTTP requests from users' browsers. It serves static content directly and forwards dynamic requests to the application server. Nginx is known for its high performance and efficiency.
Application Server:

Role: The application server processes the business logic of the website. It handles dynamic content, processes user requests, interacts with the database, and sends the appropriate responses back to the web server.
Database (MySQL):

Role: The database stores and manages the website's data, such as user information, content, and other dynamic data. MySQL is a reliable relational database management system.
Communication:

The server uses the HTTP/HTTPS protocol to communicate with the user's computer (browser). When a user requests "www.foobar.com," the web server (Nginx) receives the request, processes it with the help of the application server, retrieves necessary data from the MySQL database, and sends the response back to the user's browser.
Issues with This Infrastructure
Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

If the single server fails, the entire website becomes unavailable. There is no redundancy or failover mechanism in place.
Downtime During Maintenance:

When maintenance is needed, such as deploying new code or restarting the web server, the website will be temporarily unavailable. This can lead to downtime and a poor user experience.
Scalability:

This single-server setup cannot handle a large amount of incoming traffic. As traffic increases, the server's resources (CPU, memory, storage) may become overwhelmed, leading to slow performance or crashes.
