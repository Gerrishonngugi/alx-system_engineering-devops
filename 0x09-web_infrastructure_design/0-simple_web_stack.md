Explanation of Each Element
Load Balancer (HAProxy):

Purpose: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed, improving availability and reliability.
Distribution Algorithm: HAProxy can use several algorithms, but a common one is Round Robin, where each server gets a request in turn. This helps balance the load evenly across all servers.
Active-Active vs. Active-Passive:
Active-Active: Both servers are actively handling requests. This increases capacity and redundancy.
Active-Passive: One server handles requests while the other is on standby. If the active server fails, the passive one takes over. This setup provides redundancy but not increased capacity.
Web Server (Nginx):

Purpose: Handles HTTP requests from users, serves static content, and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server. Nginx is chosen for its high performance and low resource usage.
Application Server:

Purpose: Hosts the application code (business logic). It processes requests from the web server and communicates with the database to fetch or store data.
Database (MySQL):

Purpose: Stores and manages the data for the application. MySQL is chosen for its reliability and robustness in handling relational data.
Specifics
Load Balancer Algorithm (Round Robin):

How it works: The load balancer directs each incoming request to the next server in line. This method is simple and effective for evenly distributing the load.
Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster:

How it works: The primary (master) database node handles all write operations and replicates the data to the replica (slave) nodes, which handle read operations. This setup improves read performance and provides data redundancy.
Primary Node vs. Replica Node:
Primary Node: Handles all write and read operations and updates the replica nodes with changes.
Replica Node: Primarily handles read operations and receives data updates from the primary node. It ensures data availability and load balancing for read-heavy operations.
Issues with This Infrastructure
Single Points of Failure (SPOF):

If the load balancer fails, the entire website becomes unavailable.
If the database fails and there's no replication or backup, data loss can occur.
Security Issues:

No Firewall: The servers are vulnerable to unauthorized access and attacks.
No HTTPS: Data transmitted between users and the servers is not encrypted, making it susceptible to interception and tampering.
No Monitoring:

Without monitoring, it's challenging to detect and respond to issues such as server overload, downtime, or performance degradation. Monitoring tools are essential for maintaining the health and performance of the infrastructure.
